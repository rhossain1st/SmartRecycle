E-Waste Management MVP Snapshot 
Key Features: 
 Mobile App Interface (Google Firebase):  
o User registration, waste disposal tracking, and reward system. 
 IoT-Enabled Smart Bins (Google Cloud IoT Core):  
o Waste level monitoring and automatic waste detection via real-time sensor data. 
 AI Waste Classification (Google Gemini AI, Vertex AI):  
o Real-time classification of e-waste as recyclable, hazardous, or special disposal. 
 Blockchain Tracking (Google Cloud Blockchain Services):  
o Secure, transparent tracking of waste disposal and reward issuance. 
 Certified Recycling Integration (Google Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub):  
o Real-time interaction with recycling centers for responsible processing. 
User Flow: 
1. User Disposes of E-Waste → 
2. IoT Detects Item (Google Cloud IoT Core) → 
3. AI Classifies Waste (Google Gemini AI/Vertex AI) → 
4. Blockchain Logs Transaction (Google Cloud Blockchain Services) → 
5. Recycling Process Confirmed (Google Cloud Functions) → 
6. User Receives Rewards (Google Firebase) 
Technologies Used: 
 Mobile App (Google Firebase): For user interaction, authentication, and rewards 
tracking.

 - We are actively developing a fully functional solution powered by Google technologies 
like Gemini, IDX, and AI. By integrating Blockchain, IoT, and smart analytics, our system 
ensures efficient, transparent, and sustainable e-waste management. 
This isn’t just an idea – we are building a working prototype to automate waste classification, 
secure transactions, and reward responsible recycling. Innovation takes time, and we are 
committed to delivering a robust and scalable solution. 
Stay tuned – our MVP will be live soon, with the project link coming shortly. The future of smart 
e-waste management is in progress. 
 
 
The basic frontend has been completed and is outlined in the PowerPoint presentation. You can
